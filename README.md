# VanillaUpgrades

Source code for the Vanilla Upgrades mod.

If you use any of my code for your mods, all I ask is that you give credit for the portion you took.

# What does this mod do?

The goal of this mod is to upgrade the vanilla experience with tons of quality of life stuff. Current features are:


- Greatly increased zoom-in/movement limits of the camera in world/build views.
- Timewarp now stops when entering a planet's SoI.*
- Time slowdown, you can now use decimal timewarps and even freeze time completely. (Off by default, due to cheaty nature.)
- Physics timewarp up to 25x on all difficulties (Off by default, due to cheaty nature.)

**New UI:**
- Toggles for disabling adaptation and snapping in the build grid.
- New HUD window in world view that shows apoapsis, periapsis, eccentricity, and angle of your rocket.
- World time view, and reimplementation of 1.35's indicator saying how long you've been timewarping for.

**New Unit Displays:**

- Re-implements megameters (`Mm`) as a distance unit
- Adds `km/s` as a velocity unit
- % speed of light (`c`) as a velocity unit
- Adds `kt` as a mass and thrust unit

**New Keybinds:**

- L to launch and skip warnings in build space
- Z to toggle symmetry
- X to toggle interior view
- Tab to open the part category menu
- Slash to instantly stop timewarp
- C to set thrust to 0.1%
- T to toggle torque
- F2 to hide the UI

**New Settings:**

- Toggles for explosion shake and effects.

Mod features can be individually disabled in the config window in the game's settings menu. 

Tons more will be added in the future.

\*Inconsistent. If I find a better implementation I will use it.
