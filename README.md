# VanillaUpgrades

Source code for the Vanilla Upgrades mod.

If you use any of my code for your mods, all I ask is that you give credit for the portion you took.

# What does this mod do?

The goal of this mod is to upgrade the vanilla experience with tons of quality of life stuff. Current features are:

**New Functionality:**

- Greatly increased zoom-in/movement limits of the camera in world/build views.
- Scrollable part picker categories in build mode.
- Timewarp now stops when entering a planet's SoI.*

**New UI:**

- Show how many mods are actively loaded in the main menu. 
- Toggles for disabling adaptation and snapping in the build grid.
- New HUD in world view that shows apoapsis, periapsis, eccentricity, and angle of your rocket. This can be toggled between an addition to the vanilla UI and its own floating window.
- World time view, and reimplementation of 1.35's indicator saying how long you've been timewarping for.

**New Unit Displays:**

- Re-implements megameters (`Mm`) as a distance unit
- Adds `km/s` as a velocity unit
- % speed of light (`c`) as a velocity unit
- Adds `kt` as a mass and thrust unit

**New Cheats:**

- Time slowdown, you can now use decimal timewarps and even freeze time completely.
- Physics timewarp up to 25x on all difficulties.

**New Keybinds:**

- L to launch and skip warnings in build space
- Z to toggle symmetry
- X to toggle interior view
- Tab to open the part category menu
- Slash to instantly stop timewarp
- C to set thrust to 0.1%
- T to toggle torque
- F2 to hide the UI

**New Settings:**

- Toggles for explosion shake and effects.
- Allow the game to run while it isn't focused.
- Make percentage displays more precise by showing an extra decimal place.

**Vanilla Bug Fixes:**
- While windowed or using multiple monitors, the game will no longer zoom the camera if you scroll outside of the game window.

Mod features can be individually disabled in the config window in the game's settings menu. 

Tons more will be added in the future.

\*Inconsistent. If I find a better implementation I will use it.
