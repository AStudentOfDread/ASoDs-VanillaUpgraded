# VanillaUpgrades

Source code for the Vanilla Upgrades mod.

If you use any of my code for your mods, all I ask is that you give credit for the portion you took.

# What does this mod do?

The purpose of this mod is to add tons of quality of life features the vanilla game ought to have, or even re-implement features the game used to have that were removed.


Some notable features include:

    Greatly increased zoom-in/movement limits of the camera in world/build views.
    New cheats for time slowdown/freezing and physics timewarp up to 25x.
    Scrolling for part picker categories.
    Advanced info display, real time world clock/timewarp length.

    Reimplementation of "Exit to Main Menu" button, because having to press "Exit" twice to get back there is annoying.
    Tons of new keybinds, including hiding UI, toggling windowed mode, toggling torque for your rockets, and lots of minor QoL stuff.
    More units to condense the huge numbers certain readouts can have.
    And lots more! A complete list of features can be found [in the wiki.](https://github.com/Neptune-Sky/VanillaUpgrades/wiki)


This mod is made to be extensively customizable, the majority of features can be disabled or tweaked. The only ones that aren't are mainly common sense items that nobody would realistically want to disable, such as scrollable pick categories.
