# ASoD's VanillaUpgraded

Source code for ASoD's Vanilla Upgraded mod.

If you use any of my code for your mods, all I ask is that you give credit for the portion you took.

# What does this mod do?

The goal of this mod is to upgrade the vanilla experience with tons of quality of life stuff. Current features are:

- Toggles for disabling adaptation and snapping in the build grid.
- New HUD window in world view that shows apoapsis, periapsis, eccentricity, and angle of your rocket.

**New Unit Displays:**

- Re-implements megameters (`Mm`) as a distance unit
- Adds `km/s` as a velocity unit
- Adds `kt` as a mass and thrust unit

**New Keybinds:**

- L to launch and skip warnings in build space
- Slash to instantly stop timewarp
- Backtick to set thrust to 0.1%

Mod units and mod windows can be individually disabled in the config window in the game's settings menu.

Tons more will be added in the future.
